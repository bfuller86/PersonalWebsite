# My Personal Website
A website to display my portfolio/resume

### Getting Started
- Ensure that Node.js and Ruby are installed.
- Navigate to working directory and run "npm install"
- With a command prompt (Windows) with Ruby, run "grunt watch"

### What You Get
After any change in non-auto-generated files (index.html, GruntFile.js, app/*, etc) the website should be compiled, concatenated, minified, and moved to the folder:
```
<working directory>/build
```

Deployment and web hosting are not done for you, must be deployed and hosted through other means/manually.
